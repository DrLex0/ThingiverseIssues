# TamperMonkey workaround scripts for the Thingiverse website

These scripts require the TamperMonkey (or compatible) browser extension.

They try to fix some of the most annoying problems with the Thingiverse website by modifying its HTML code on-the-fly.
If it isn't obvious from the script's name, look at its `@description` line to see what it does.

Use at your own risk. I have only tested these scripts (if at all) with TamperMonkey in Chrome.
Because MakerBot changes the website at random moments without warning, these scripts may stop working at any moment. File an issue or create a pull request if you know how to fix a script.
